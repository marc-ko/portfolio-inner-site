                <p>
                    From a young age, I have had a curiosity about how things
                    worked. This naturally led me to become absolutely obsessed
                    with building things. In my elementary school, I tried learning how to use my broken HP PC in my house to build a local web server by C# which was the first exposure to web developement.

                <p> In
                    high school, I joined school's STEM and that is the very first time hands-on experience to embbed programming. With the aid from teachers and friends, I decided to take a step further and started learning Python and Java. I started to build small projects with Raspberry PI for fun and to learn more about the world of software development.

                <p>
                    Ever since then, I started programming more seriously and started
                    learning how to scrape and interact with websites.

                    In 2021, I got accepted into Hong Kong University of Science and Technology to study Computer Enginnering. It was my first choice to expore the world of soft-hardware
                    and I was absolutely ecstatic to be going to such a great
                    university. At the beginning of my second year, I got into HKUST Robotics Team Robocon Subteam, primarily focusing
                    on RTOS Embbeded Programming., until the start of my senior
                    year when I decided to focus on other opportunities.

                            Beyond software, I have a lot of hobbies that I
                            enjoy doing in my free time. The more tangible
                            hobbies I have are{' '}

                            and creating{' '}
                            <Link to="/projects/art">Digital Art</Link>. You can

                            pages under my projects tab. Some other hobbies I
                            enjoy are working out, cooking, and (unsurprisingly)
                            playing video games.

                            In college, I was an active member in the fraternity
                            Sigma Alpha Epsilon and held multiple positions in
                            the chapter. I met a lot of amazing people through
                            my fraternity and thoroughly enjoyed the community.
